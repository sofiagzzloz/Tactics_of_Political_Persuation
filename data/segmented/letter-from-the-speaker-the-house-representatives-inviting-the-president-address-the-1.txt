The President The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr.

President: As our nation marks the Semiquincennial Anniversary of American Independence, the United States stands stronger, freer, and more prosperous under your leadership and bold action.

Together in 2025, your administration and the 119th Congress delivered one of the most consequential agendas in history, and Americans across this great country will experience the tangible results of commonsense governance.

We look forward to advancing the important work ahead of us in 2026, serving the American people, defending liberty, and preserving this grand experiment in self-governance.

To that end, it is my distinct honor and great privilege to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, February 24, 2026, in the Chamber of the U.S.
