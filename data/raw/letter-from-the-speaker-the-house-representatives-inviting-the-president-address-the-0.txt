Dear Mr. President:
America's Golden Age has begun. Thanks to your strong leadership and bold action in the first days of your presidency, the United States is already experiencing a resurgence of patriotism, unity, and hope for the future.
Your administration and the 119th Congress working together have the chance to make these next four years some of the most consequential in our nation's history. To that end, it is my distinct honor and great privilege to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, March 4, 2025, in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives, to share your America First vision for our legislative future. I eagerly await your response.
Sincerely,
MIKE JOHNSON
Speaker of the House
